# Snake
I did this project for fun in my Senior year of high school. It is a snake
game that can be played by a person or by an AI I made. The AI is not great.
It will never win since it always eventually blocks itself in, but I'm proud
of the results nonetheless. I logged my updates in the Snake.java class.
